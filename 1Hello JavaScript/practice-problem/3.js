/* Problem-1: write a function called foo() which prints 'foo' and a function called bar() which prints 'bar' . call function bar() in the foo() function after printing. What will be the output?Now call the foo() to see the output. */

/* Problem-2: Write a function called make_avg() which will take an array of integers and return the average of those values. */


/* Problem-3: challenging : write a function called make_avg() which will take and array  of integers and the size of that array and return the average of those values. */
 
/* Problem-4: write a function odd_even() which takes an integer value and tells whether this value is even or odd. You need to do this in 4 ways:
>has return +has parameters
>No return +has parameters */

/* Problem-5: You are in a hurry to go to your school on time. But when you are crossing the road, the traffic signal is red colored. In this situation, if you try to cross the road, you may be in danger. If you notice yellow colored traffic signal, you should stop. If you notice green colored traffic signal, you should cross the road. So write a js code, where there is a variable called signal. Its value can be green, yellow or red and we will get different activities as output depending  on the variable. So, hurry up. */
