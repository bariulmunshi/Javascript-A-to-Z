/* 1) You have an array [ 1, 9, 17, 22 ]. Add the all elements
of this array and give output. Do this using for loop &
array.reduce() method. */

/*
const people=[
    {name:'Mina',age:21},
    {name:'Rina',age:23},
    {name:'shuhorita',age:26}
];
 1) Challenging Follow above array of objects. So, you have 3 objects as
array element. Can you find out the total sum from here?

20 + 15 + 22 = 57 . The output will be 57

What are you thinking? Yeah! Do it with for loop. I know you can do it.
But! Wait !! Wait !!! Do the same task using array.reduce() method. */
